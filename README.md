# Connect-4-Game
Simple Connect 4 game to play against friends or a slightly competitive computer!

Using the games built in CS 32 as a guide, this Connect 4 game has the same basic structure of 3 classes: a board, a player, and a game class. The player class has a built in player you can play against; it has a simple sense of how to choose winning moves or oppose your winning moves. Built for fun to play with friends, enjoy!
